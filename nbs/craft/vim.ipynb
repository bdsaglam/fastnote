    "\n\n## Basics\n\n\n\n### Command-line\n\n\n\n- `:q` quit (close window)\n\n- `:w` save (\"write\")\n\n- `:wq` save and quit\n\n- `:e {name of file}` open file for editing\n\n- `:ls` show open buffers\n\n- `:bp` `:bn` switch between buffers\n\n- `:help {topic}` open help\n\n    - `:help :w` opens help for the `:w` command\n\n    - `:help w` opens help for the `w` movement\n\n\n\n### Movement\n\n\n\n- Basic movement: `hjkl` (left, down, up, right)\n\n- Words: `w` (next word), `b` (beginning of word), `e` (end of word)\n\n- Lines: `0` (beginning of line), `^` (first non-blank character), `$` (end of line)\n\n    - When a line is wrapped, it is displayed in multiple visual lines.\n\n    Motions become confusing with display lines as they constitute a vim line object. By prepending motion keys with `g`, we can instead modify motion commands to take display lines into accounts. For example, `gk` moves one display line upward. `g0` goes to the beginning of the display line, instead of beginning of vim line object.\n\n- Screen: `H` (top of screen), `M` (middle of screen), `L` (bottom of screen)\n\n- Scroll with cursor: `<C-u>` (up), `<C-d>` (down)\n\n- Scroll only screen not cursor: `<C-y>` (up), `<C-e>` (down)\n\n- `zz` to center the cursor vertically on your screen, e.g. 250gzz\n\n- File: `gg` (beginning of file), `G` (end of file)\n\n- Line numbers: `:{number}<CR>` or `{number}G` (line {number})\n\n- Jump to matching character such as (), [], {} by `%` \n\n- Find: `f{character}`, `t{character}`, `F{character}`, `T{character}`\n\n    - find/to forward/backward {character} on the current line\n\n    - `,` / `;` for navigating matches\n\n- Search: `/{regex}`, `n` / `N` for navigating matches\n\n    - `*` find next occurrence of word under cursor\n\n    - `#` find previous occurrence of word under cursor\n\n    - `gn` / `gN` also visually select matches, which is handy for rerunnin commands with `.`\n\n- Go back/forward with `<C-o>`/`<C-i>`\n\n- CamelCaseMotion\n\n    - `<leader>{w|b|e|ge}`\n\n    - `ci<leader>w`\n\n- Folding\n\n    - `zo` open fold, `zO` open all folds on the cursor\n\n    - `zc` close fold, `zC` close all folds on the cursor\n\n    - `za` toggle fold, `zA` toggle all folds on the cursor\n\n    - `zr` open one more level of fold, `zR` open all folds independent of the cursor\n\n    - `zm` close one more level of fold, `zM` close all folds independent of the cursor\n\n- Marks\n\n    - `m{lowercase character}` to create a local mark\n\n    - `m{uppercase character}` to create a global mark\n\n    - `{char} jump to mark\n\n    - Quickly come back `mm` and `m\n\n\n\n### Counts\n\n\n\n- `3w` move 3 words forward\n\n- `5j` move 5 lines down\n\n- `7dw` delete 7 words\n\n\n\n### Visual mode\n\n\n\n- Visual: `v`\n\n- Visual line: `V`\n\n- Visual block (multi cursor): `^v`\n\n    - it does not show the command on all lines but applies when escaped\n\n- Toggle cursor position to either ends of visual selection with `o`\n\n\n\n### Edits\n\n\n\n- Insert mode\n\n    - `i` puts cursor before the current place \n\n    - `I` puts cursor at the beginning of current line\n\n    - `a` puts cursor after the current place \n\n    - `A` puts cursor at the end of current line\n\n- `o` / `O` insert line below / above\n\n- `d{motion}` delete {motion}\n\n    - `dw` is delete word\n\n    - `d$` is delete to end of line\n\n    - `d0` is delete to beginning of line\n\n    - deleted text put into unnamed register `\"`\n\n    - `\"_d{motion}` delete into black hole so that it does not change unnamed register\n\n- `D` delete rest of the line (equal to `d$`)\n\n- `c{motion}` change {motion}\n\n    - `cw` is change word\n\n- `C` change rest of the line (equal to `Di`)\n\n- `>{motion}` indent\n\n- `<{motion}` dedent\n\n- `x` delete character (equal do `dl`)\n\n- `r` replace one character\n\n- `s` substitute character (equal to `xi`)\n\n- `S` substitute line (equal to `ddO` or `0C`)\n\n- Visual mode + manipulation\n\n    - select text, `d` to delete it or `c` to change it\n\n- `u` to undo, `<C-r>` to redo\n\n- `y` to copy / \"yank\" (some other commands like `d` also copy)\n\n    - all yanked texts are saved into numbered registers(0,1,2...), like a queue. \n\n    `:reg` list all registers.\n\n    - copy to a register by `\"{character}y` and then paste it by `\"{character}p`\n\n        - `\"*y` copy to system clipboard\n\n        - `\"*p` paste from system clipboard\n\n        - copy content of register `a` to register `b`\n\n            ```vim\n\n            :let @b=@a\n\n            ```\n\n- Paste \n\n    - `p` to paste in normal mode\n\n    - `<C-r> <register>` to paste in insert mode \n\n        - `<C-r> \"` to paste unnamed register in insert mode \n\n    - after pasting over a visual selection, that visual selection is put into unnamed register\n\n- `~` flips the case of a character\n\n- `gu{motion}` lowercase `gU{motion}` uppercase\n\n- Text objects\n\n    - `aw` word including white space after\n\n    - `iw` inner word\n\n    - `it` inner tag\n\n    - `i\"` inner quotes\n\n    - `ip` inner paragraphs\n\n    - `as` as sentence\n\n    - `aa` as argument\n\n    - `ia` inner argument\n\n- Delete until next occurence including new lines `d/{regex} + enter`\n\n- `<C-A>` increment `<C-X>` decrement\n\n\n\n### Modifiers\n\n\n\n- `ci(` change the contents inside the current pair of parentheses\n\n- `ci[` change the contents inside the current pair of square brackets\n\n- `da'` delete a single-quoted string, including the surrounding single quotes\n\n\n\n### Command mode\n\n\n\nsyntax `:<range><command>`\n\n- To substitute new for the first old in a line type\n\n- current line\n\n    - `:s/old/new` first occurrence of `old` in current line\n\n    - `:s/old/new/g` all occurrences of `old` in current line\n\n    - `:.s/old/new/g`\n\n- last line `$`\n\n- a specific line `:21s/old/new/g`\n\n- `%` entire file, e.g. `:%s/old/new/g`\n\n- to ask for confirmation each time add `c` \n\n    - `:%s/old/new/gc`\n\n- `11,15` from line 11 to 15 both inclusive, e.g. `:11,15s/old/new/g`\n\n- `.,.+5` from current line to 5 lines after\n\n-  delete all lines that matches pattern `:g/pattern/d`\n\n-  delete all lines that does not match pattern\n\n    - `:!g/pattern/d`\n\n    - `:v/pattern/d`\n\n- put a new line after every line, i.e. double space lines, `:g/^/pu =\\\"\\n\\\"`\n\n- delete every empty line, `:g/^\\s*$/d`\n\n- reverse lines, `:g/^/m0` move every line to the first line\n\n- execute a command on a range  `:'<,'>normal A;`\n\n  - puts `;` to the end of each line\n\n- execute a macro on range `:'<,'>normal @a`\n\n- `:6t.` copy line 6 to current line\n\n- `:{range}m$` move range to the end of the file\n\n- `@:` repeat last Ex command\n\n- `<C-r><C-w>` copies the word under the cursor to the command-line prompt\n\n- command window (cmdwin) is useful for finding previous commands and searches as it allows editing with vim\n\n    - `q:` in normal mode and `<C-f>` in command mode to open command history\n\n    - `q/` or `q?` for search history\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Macros\n\n\n\n- `q{lowercase character}` to start recording a macro in register \n\n- `q{uppercase character}` to append an existing macro in register\n\n- `q` to stop recording\n\n- `@{character}` replays the macro\n\n- Macro execution stops on error\n\n- `{number}@{character}` executes a macro {number} times\n\n- Macros can be recursive\n\n    - first clear the macro with `q{character}q`\n\n    - record the macro, with `@{character}` to invoke the macro recursively\n\n    (will be a no-op until recording is complete)\n\n- Example: convert xml to json ([file](/2020/files/example-data.xml))\n\n    - Array of objects with keys \"name\" / \"email\"\n\n    - Use a Python program?\n\n    - Use sed / regexes\n\n        - `g/people/d`\n\n        - `%s/<person>/{/g`\n\n        - `%s/<name>\\(.*\\)<\\/name>/\"name\": \"\\1\",/g`\n\n        - ...\n\n    - Vim commands / macros\n\n        - `Gdd`, `ggdd` delete first and last lines\n\n        - Macro to format a single element (register `e`)\n\n            - Go to line with `<name>`\n\n            - `qe^r\"f>s\": \"<ESC>f<C\"<ESC>q`\n\n        - Macro to format a person\n\n            - Go to line with `<person>`\n\n            - `qpS{<ESC>j@eA,<ESC>j@ejS},<ESC>q`\n\n        - Macro to format a person and go to the next person\n\n            - Go to line with `<person>`\n\n            - `qq@pjq`\n\n        - Execute macro until end of file\n\n            - `999@q`\n\n        - Manually remove last `,` and add `[` and `]` delimiters\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Plugins\n\n\n\nWith the plugin manager, [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), we can easily add a new plugin to `.vimrc`. \n\nDon't forget to reload `.vimrc` and `:PlugInstall` to install plugins.\n\n\n\n### vim-surround\n\n\n\n[Docs and examples](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround/blob/master/doc/surround.txt)\n\n\n\n- `ysiw[` surround word with `[]` \n\n- Wrap the entire line in parentheses with `yss)`\n\n* whee! -> `v4lS'` -> 'whee!'\n\n* \"hello\" -> ysWfprint<cr> -> print(\"hello\")\n\n* A custom surround command defined for markdown which surrounds visual selection with markdown code block of prompted language.\n\n    ```vim\n\n    let b:surround_99 = \"```\\1lang: \\1\\r```\"\n\n    ```\n\n    - pwd -> `VScbash<enter>` -> \n\n\n\n        \\```sh\n\n\n\n        pwd\n\n\n\n        \\```\n\n\n\n### vim-commentary\n\n\n\n- `gc{motion}` to toggle comment out\n\n- `gcc` to toggle line comment out\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Advanced Vim\n\n\n\n### Search and replace\n\n\n\n`:s` (substitute) command ([documentation](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace)).\n\n\n\n- `:%s/foo/bar/g`\n\n    - replace foo with bar globally in file\n\n- `:%s/\\[.*\\](\\(.*\\))/\\1/g`\n\n    - replace named Markdown links with plain URLs\n\n\n\n### Multiple files and viewports\n\n\n\n#### File exploration\n\nVim displays buffers in windows and tabs. \n\n- `:Explore` or `:E` opens file explorer\n\n- fzf.vim commands\n\n    - `:Files` lists files in cwd\n\n    - `:Buffer` lists current open buffers\n\n    - `:Windows` lists current open windows\n\n    - `<C-T>` to open the selected file in new tab\n\n    - `<C-X>` to open the selected file in horizontal split\n\n    - `<C-V>` to open the selected file in vertical split\n\n    - My fzf.vim shortcuts\n\n        - `<leader>f :Buffers<CR>`\n\n        - `<leader>t :Files<CR>`\n\n        - `<leader>rg :Rg<CR>` ripgrep, i.e. search keyword in files\n\n        - `<leader>l :BLines<CR>` show lines matching search term, more useful than `/`\n\n        - `<leader>m :Marks<CR>`\n\n        - `<leader>h :History<CR>` file history\n\n        - `<leader>: :History:<CR>` command history\n\n        - `<leader>/ :History/<CR>` search history\n\n\n\n#### Tabs\n\nA tab can have multiple windows.\n\n- `tabnew filename` opens a new tab\n\n- `gt` to switch between tabs\n\n- `{number}gt` goes to numbered tab. Numbering starts from 1.\n\n- `:q` to close current tab\n\n\n\n#### Windows (Splits)\n\n- `:sp` / `:vsp` to split windows\n\n- `<C-w>[hjkl]` to navigate between windows\n\n- `<C-w>q` to close window. Be careful `q` closes the whole tab.\n\n- We can have multiple views of the same buffer with windows. \n\nUseful for viewing different parts of a file.\n\n\n\n### Terminal in vim\n\n- `:terminal` or `:ter` to open a terminal\n\n    - `:below vert terminal` to open a terminal at right split\n\n    - `:ter ++curwin` to open in current window without splitting\n\n- `<C-w>N` to enter to Normal mode \n\n- `<C-w>:` to enter to Command mode \n\n- `i` to enter Insert mode\n\n- `:sp` or `:vsp` to split terminal window in Normal mode\n\n- `<C-w>c` to close window\n\n- `<C-d>` to quit window\n\n\n\n## Best practices\n\n\n\n#### Vim Can Save You Hours Of Work\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bshMXXX40_4)\n\n\n\n- `ddp` to swap lines\n\n- `/keyword/m$` to move line matches keyword to last\n\n- `/keyword/+1m-2` to move the next line of the line matches keyword to two lines up\n\n- `:10,20>` indent lines between 10 and 20\n\n- `:10,20 norm A\"` insert \" to every the end of lines between 10 and 20\n\n- `:ab bds Baris Deniz Saglam` define abbreviation\n\n    - add `^` to end of word to prevent expansion\n\n- `:w !sudo tee %` write to current file when not have permission\n"
