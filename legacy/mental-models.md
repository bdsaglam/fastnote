# Mental Models

## Two modes; decision maker and executor

Operate in two modes to be more effective and productive

Phase 1: Decision making
- Inspect the problem and set a goal
- Do a thorough analysis of situation
- Collect data, anectodes, analogies, past examples
- Think in first principles
- Make abstractions and create mental modesl
- Question assumptions, postulate hypotheses
- Consider alternative solutions and their risks and efforts
- Devise a strategy and a flywheel feedback loop for continious improvement
- Make a time framed plan
- Design processes and habits

Phase 2: Execution
- Do not question the goal or plan  
- Do not analyze the situation
- Do not think new strategies
- Find the most effective, efficient and fast way of executing the plan
- Implement processes
- Monitor key metrics
- Note down the findings to later evaluate in Phase 1
- Automate as much as possible

## Design or Hack-n-Churn

Whenever we decide to create a new product or a feature, there comes the question of "how to do it". There are two approaches; 

1. First design, then implement
2. Try alternative implementations and design later

Both approaches have pros and cons. In the first one, we have the advantage of 
spotting problems and making important decisions early, hence, improving the implementation quality. 
However, all designs are imperfect and we may still discover unknown unknows during implementation. 
When the design is poor, it quickly diverges from the implementation and become useless at best.
To eliminate poor design decisions, the organizations hold design reviews where a design is documented
in some form and then reviewed by team members and stakeholders. If this process is carried on
seriously and productively, then the quality of design improves significantly. However, many organizations' culture
are not capable of doing it, especially startups. Many young organizations, instead, prefer 
hacking things and iterating quickly to reach an optimal solution. If the problem is 
highly ambigious or the solution should be disruptive, this works much better than
preliminary designs. However, this has the risk of investing into wrong decisions. 
Considering all these, here is a rule of thumb that guide such decisions: 
- When the implementation is cheap to do and the actions can be easily reversed, 
skip design phase and jump straight to implementing. 
- If it's costly to reverse decisions or there are too many alternative solutions known already, 
design a few solutions and review them.
