https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function
A function is;
- injective (one-to-one) when all elements in domain (X) maps to unique element in codomain (Y)
- surjective (onto) when there is at least one element in domain for each element in codomain
- bijective when both injective and surjective, i.e. invertible
