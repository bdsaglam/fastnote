## Linked Lists
- Recursion brings reverse processing to singly linked list
- Two pointers brings doubly linked list functionality to singly linked list
- The data is important, not the memory adress
- Fast and slow pointers to put one in middle the other beginning by moving fast

- If length odd, put both pointers to head
- If length even, put slow pointer head and fast pointer to head.next
