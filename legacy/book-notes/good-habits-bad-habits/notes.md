## Go public
We found one particularly interesting common trigger for people to become self-conscious of their habits: being with others. Just being around people is enough to turn the spotlight inward and to start to monitor what you would normally do without much scrutiny at all. This is potentially useful if you ever feel like you just aren’t very aware of your habitual self (and would like to be): Go public. You’ll have a better sense of self in no time.

## Just do it
We concluded that the speed with which repeated actions are cued by contexts is central to habits. It can keep runners heading out to the track even when they feel tired. If they took the time to deliberate, they might decide not to go that day or to take a shorter route than typical. When people slow down to think, anything might change.
